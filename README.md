# svg-icon-system-react

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) but has been ejected. Run `npm start` to serve or `npm build` to build. If you make changes to the loader, you will have to restart the app to pick up the changes.

To add icons, you just put them into the 'src/Icon/icons' directory. The slug used for the filename must match the slug passed from the icon component.
